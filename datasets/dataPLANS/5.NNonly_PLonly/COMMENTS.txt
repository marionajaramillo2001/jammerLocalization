PL scenario:

beta 0, does not prevent APBM from wirking well with PL. The NN is not overpowering anything. rather, it converges to coorect parameters. Maybe is because not each param should be zero since the NN ends adding a DC to balance the lack of P0 info

beta0 con grad estimation va molto meglio! ricontrolla! sarebbe meglio non fosse cos√¨...

NN only sucks as it should be

Betainf is doing good, better than PLonly.. do not know why


RT scenario:

beta0 is working better than NNonly. It is alright: the PL model is present under the RT so the APBM with a "free running" NN works well. It should work maybe as good as beta=1

NN is not working good.that's the beauty if this method

betainf and PLonly are almost equivalent (~18m). PL only and betainf should indeed behave the same. The small difference in the PL scenario must be due to some nuisance
